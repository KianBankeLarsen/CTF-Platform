## Introduction
The motivation behind this Master's Thesis lies in the need for a robust and secure Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. CTF is a type of cybersecurity competition designed to challenge participants' knowledge and skills in various aspects of information security. These competitions are often used as educational tools, team-building exercises, or even as recruiting grounds for cybersecurity talent.  As cybersecurity challenges become increasingly complex, educational institutions and organizations seek effective ways to train students and professionals in offensive and defensive techniques.
