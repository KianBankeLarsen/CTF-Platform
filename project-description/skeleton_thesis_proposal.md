## Thesis Proposal Skeleton

Write a 1 or 2 pages document structured as follows.

### Title
Provide a concise and descriptive title for your thesis.

### Motivation & Goal
Clearly state the motivation behind your research and the primary goal you aim to achieve.

### Plan of Activities
Describe the task to perform the thesis. These should include if possible

1. Survey of the Art
Conduct a thorough literature review.
List key references (books, articles, online material) that you will start to use to consult to understand the current state of research.
This allows the study board to make sure that you know where to start.

2. Development or Research Phase
Outline the methodology you will use.
Describe in general terms what you will do and how you will do it.

3. Experiments
Detail the experiments you plan to conduct.
Specify the research question you aim to answer and the type of experiments required.

4. Analysis
Describe how you will analyze the data collected from your experiments.
Include a plan for additional time to rerun experiments if necessary.

5. Finalizing the Report/Thesis
Detail the process for writing the final report or thesis.
Ensure it follows academic conventions as outlined by Justin Zobel (Writing for Computer Science. Springer 2014, ISBN 978-1-4471-6638-2, pp. 1-264.). The book is freely available online via the library.

### Tentative Time Plan
Provide a timeline for each major milestone, with intervals such as every 2 weeks or 1 month.

### Risk Evaluation

Identify potential risks (e.g., difficulty in obtaining data).
Propose possible remedies (e.g., use anonymized data, simulate data).

### Outcome
Describe the material that you will submit at the end of the project. 
The expected outcomes include:

* A report written in English, adhering to standard academic writing conventions, that discusses...
	(Provide a two-line description of the report content.)
* The code and data developed or used in the project.
* Relevant results and data from the experiments.

### Bibliography
List all the references you plan to use to start the investigation of the state of the art.
