<h1 class="title">Trusted Connection</h1>

<div class="description" data-aos="fade-down">
<p>We have applied a trusted Let's Encrypt certificate to all our known domains using an <code>HTTP-01</code> ACME challenge. Ideally, this should have been a wildcard certificate using a <code>DNS-01</code> challenge, but due to certain limitations, we are unable to automate the certificate request and renewal. Simply requesting a certificate for each subdomain could trigger a Let's Encrypt rate limit. This limitation forces us to apply a certificate from our self-hosted CA to the challenges deployed, as they are deployed on their own randomly generated subdomain. This CA is not trusted unless you configure your OS to do soâ€”please follow the guide below.</p>

<p>If you are using Windows, you are in luck because the browsers on this OS use the default trust store. The trust store on Linux is a bit more complicated, as browsers like Firefox use their own certificate databases and thereby ignore the certificates installed on the OS. For that reason, we have decided to only support Firefox on Linux. If you prefer to use another browser, you can try to manually import the certificate into its certificate database. You might find this <a class="highlight-link" href="https://thomas-leister.de/en/how-to-import-ca-root-certificate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">source</a> helpful. Most tooling on both OSs should use the default trust store, but there are exceptions like Java, which uses its own KeyStore.</p>

<p>The subsequent commands require the Step-CLI to be installed on your system. You can install Step-CLI on Linux using the command below. If you are on Windows, please refer to their <a class="highlight-link" href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation/#windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Windows installation guide</a>.</p>

<pre data-aos="zoom-in-right">
<code class="language-bash">wget https://dl.smallstep.com/cli/docs-cli-install/latest/step-cli_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i step-cli_amd64.deb</code></pre>

<p>You can then install the root certificate into the OS's default trust store by executing the command given below.</p>

<pre data-aos="zoom-in-left">
<code class="language-bash">step ca bootstrap \
    --ca-url https://{{site.ssh_step_ca_host}} \
    --fingerprint {{site.ssh_step_ca_fingerprint}} \
    --install</code></pre>

<p>The command below can be used on Linux to install the root certificate into Firefox or Java.</p>

<pre data-aos="zoom-in-left">
<code class="language-bash">CERTFOLDER=/etc/ssl/certs 
step certificate install $CERTFOLDER/$(ls -t $CERTFOLDER | grep Step | head -n 1) --firefox --java --no-system</code></pre>

<p>A similar command can be used on Windows; you simply have to specify the exact certificate that you want to install. The bootstrap command will provide you with its location on the OS.</p>

<pre data-aos="zoom-in-left">
<code class="language-bash">step install certificate &lt;certPath&gt; --java --firefox --no-system</code></pre>

<p>The steps shown in this section are not mandatory unless you want to verify the HTTPS connection.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If we rotate the root certificate for any reason, and you have previously installed the root certificate in your browser, you should either update the certificate or remove the old one. Use this command to do it: <pre><code class="language-bash">step certificate uninstall &lt;certPath&gt; --all</code></pre> Otherwise, your browser may display a signature error. You cannot bypass this prompt. However, in Chrome and Edge, you can type "thisisunsafe" on your keyboard to continue.</p>
